# Auto Form to Email Pipeline

A super duper cool (and completely unnecessary) pipeline I wrote to take in data from google enrollment forms I created for a course I teach, and auto send emails to all students interested in enrolling in the course with their corresponding enrollment code. 

For easiest use, visit `send_announcement.ipynb`. This notebook is the best documented example on how to use the pipeline. There is some backend necessary to make the google API compatable. If you have questions, please contact me at jamessunseri@berkeley.edu
